# Code solutions

## What are the codes for?

All the codes posted here are the solutions to various coding challenges from various platforms such as Hackerrank, Codechef, etc. The codes are self explanatory. I have used Jupyter Notebook to solve Python problems and Nano editor for C++ probelms. You can go through the files and see the source code along with binary files in the c++ directory.

## What have I learned?

I have learned basic algorithms, data structures and various syntax of famous programming languages. I try to solve all the problems with O(N) time complexity.
